Hello!

DESCRIPTION AND WORKING OF THE GAME:

This game is all about cricket
in india people love cricket and many ppl play cricket just using handsigns as runs and only requires two players to play it
first step is to choose who bats/bowls first
this is done by choosing odd or even by player 1
and they show finger which tells the number they want to choose, both at the same time
and if they add total of fingers of both players and the sum is odd/even
the person who chose the correct predict gets to choose wheather he/she wants to bat/bowl.
so for example if player 1 chooses bating and player two get bowling,
they are supposed to show max of 6 fingers but rules change as per their wish.
both the players show the hand at the same time
if player 1 who is batting shows 5 fingers and player 2 shows finger 3.
player 1 gets 5 runs as thats the number of fingers he showed
and suppose both the players show the same number of fingers, player 1 gets eliminated and player 2 gets to bat now
so lets say player 1 scored 50 runs, player 2 has to score more than 50 runs
this is how the game works.

RULES OF GAME:
total wickets per person : 3(u can change as per your wish)
the game is you vs the computer

Good luck :)
